I'm thinking of one unfortunate phenomenon in particular of unique interest to my station... both as a professional and as a sufferer of this vampiric condition. It seems the stream of time has begun to erode the moorings of my chosen course of study... for the methodologies that gave birth to psychology are slowly disappearing. I find myself in an era that overlooks the physical component of psychological pathology time... and again in favour of the sophistic practices of Freud. Phrenology, dactopindalism, and the rest of the old guard is fallen by the wayside... its champions all silenced in death with my unique exception. Would that I could make my voice heard again although it may be suspicious... should I return to popular medical discourse fifty years after my apparent death. No, better that I continue my studies into the psychosis in secret. One day may I hold up my own cure as validation of the methods. I am confident no cure for my condition or that of my beloved wife lies within our figurative minds... waiting to be unlocked by the correct combination of memories recovered from our childhoods. And I'm most certain that it has nothing to do with the relationship between myself, my parents, and my genitals. Sorry, Sigmund, but I choose to stay my course.

I have concluded that their fundamental understanding... of the vampiric condition is woefully lacking... and mired in suspicion and pseudo-religious dogma... that would make a Turk balk for its strictures.

These voices seem to echo from deep within my fellow vampires... and I cannot be certain if this symptom belongs to my strain of the illness or theirs... for the voices are various and inconsistent.

Bringing the Giovanni family one step closer to the endless night we have toiled to bring about all these centuries! Once again, the American Giovanni are poised to make a grand return to a position of esteem. And to celebrate this momentous occasion, I have decided to embrace two of you.
